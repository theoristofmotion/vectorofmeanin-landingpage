    <p>
      I am beyond excited to share that <strong>The Vector of Meaning</strong> is launching this fall. This book is the foundation of a much larger system—a creative framework that blends philosophy, personal transformation, and practical tools for navigating tension with clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't just a book. It's the beginning of an evolving platform of workbooks, workshops, certification programs, and community-driven development. Whether you're here to reflect, rebuild, or reimagine—you're not alone. You're part of a system designed to move you forward, not with perfection, but with purpose.
    </p>

      Sign up below to stay in the loop as we prepare for launch, and get early insights into the tools, models, and stories that make up The Vector of Meaning system.

      The <strong>Vector of Meaning Workbook</strong> is already available and offers a powerful hands-on experience. It’s more than just a companion—it’s a tool for transformation. Inside, you'll find guided prompts, custom diagrams, and a framework for applying the system to your everyday decisions. It’s the first physical piece of a much larger journey.

    “Hi! I read the prologue to your book and would love to read more when you are ready to share. I thought the references to your faith were well said and not "preachy". Overall it was a compelling invitation to keep reading.”<br />

  <p class="founder-note">
    I created The Vector of Meaning after walking through my own collapse—and finding purpose in the tension. 
    I hope this work helps you as much as it’s helped me. — Brandyn Holloway
